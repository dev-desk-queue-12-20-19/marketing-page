            <li>The student will be able to login and see tickets
                that are open for help.

            <li>
                We are able to help create a new ticket including title and
                description.
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>
                Students are also more than welcome to login and view a lit of open tickets.
                This allows us to assign a ticket to ourselves by clicking 'help student'.
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>
                We are also able to mark tickets as resolved or ressign the ticket back
                if we cannot solve it. This will allow someone else to pick it up and help.
